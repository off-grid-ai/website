An RTX card with 8GB of VRAM can denoise a full SDXL image in seconds, and a 12GB card barely notices the load. That hardware was built for exactly this kind of parallel math, yet it idles in your case while you wait in a web queue and watch a credit counter tick down. Off Grid AI Desktop is a free, open-source app that generates images directly on your Windows PC.

**[GitHub →](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop)** Free, open source, runs offline.

It bundles `stable-diffusion.cpp` and runs it through CUDA on NVIDIA cards or Vulkan on AMD and Intel. Your prompts and your images stay on your machine.

## What You Need

The story on Windows is VRAM. More of it means bigger models and higher resolutions without spilling to system RAM.

| Tier | GPU / RAM | What runs well |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum | 4-6GB VRAM, or CPU only | SD 1.5, SDXL-Lightning at low steps |
| Recommended | RTX 8GB VRAM, 16GB RAM | SDXL-Lightning, Z-Image-Turbo, smooth |
| Comfortable | RTX 12-16GB VRAM, 32GB RAM | Full SDXL, larger sizes and batches |

You need Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit) and roughly 6-12GB of free disk per image model. Models download on demand, so the floor is set by what you choose to pull.

## What Off Grid AI Desktop Can Do

You get a full local image studio that uses the GPU you already paid for. Prompt, watch it render, keep the result. No queue, no credits.

**Run the 2026 model lineup.** SDXL for quality. SDXL-Lightning for fast few-step output. SD 1.5 and 2.1 for lighter loads. Z-Image-Turbo, the 2026 flagship, reaches a finished image in about 8 steps.

**See every step.** A live per-step preview shows the image forming. Progress and ETA tell you where you are, and a cancel button stops a bad run before it finishes wasting your GPU.

**Go from text or from an image.** Text-to-image builds from a prompt. Image-to-image takes a picture you drop in and reworks it toward your prompt while keeping the structure you want.

**Lean on style presets.** Sketch, Cinematic, Anime, and more apply a tuned look, so you name the subject and let the preset carry the style.

**Keep everything.** Generated images collect in an artifacts gallery, and any one opens full size in a lightbox.

## Which Models to Use

Pick by VRAM. That is the constraint that decides what runs well.

| Your GPU | Model | What to expect |
|---|---|---|
| 4-6GB / CPU | SD 1.5, SDXL-Lightning | Quick output, modest resolution |
| RTX 8GB | Z-Image-Turbo, SDXL-Lightning | Strong images in a few steps |
| RTX 12GB+ | Full SDXL | Best quality, larger batches |

On 8GB cards, the few-step models are the comfortable default. SDXL-Lightning and Z-Image-Turbo reach a usable image in a fraction of the steps standard SDXL needs, which is the biggest factor in how long you wait.

## How Hardware Acceleration Works

Generation is an iterative denoising loop. The model starts from noise and refines it over a set number of steps, and each step is heavy matrix math. On NVIDIA hardware, `stable-diffusion.cpp` runs that math through CUDA. On AMD and Intel GPUs it uses Vulkan. With no usable GPU, it falls back to the CPU and runs slower.

Unlike a Mac, a Windows discrete GPU has its own dedicated VRAM separate from system RAM. Weights load into VRAM, and as long as the model fits there, generation is fast. When a model overflows VRAM into system memory, speed drops sharply, which is why quantization and few-step models matter on smaller cards.

Quantization shrinks the weights from 16-bit down to 8 or 4 bits, so an SDXL checkpoint fits an 8GB card with room to spare.

## Getting Sharper Images Faster

Three settings carry most of the speed.

Steps trade time for quality. With Lightning and Turbo models, hold near their intended low step count. Piling on steps wastes GPU time without a better picture.

Resolution scales quadratically. Doubling each dimension quadruples the work and the VRAM. Generate at the model's native size, then upscale separately.

Keep the model inside VRAM. If you see generation crawl, drop to a smaller or more heavily quantized model rather than letting it spill into system RAM.

## Privacy: Stronger Than a Cloud Image Generator

A cloud image service uploads your prompt and stores the output. Many train on what users make. Most gate generation behind a paid plan and a logged-in account.

Off Grid AI Desktop does the work on your own GPU. Nothing uploads. There is no account, no telemetry, no credit meter. The code is AGPL-3.0, so you can read exactly how it handles your data. Pull the network cable and it still generates.

## Getting Started

1. Open the repo: [github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop).
2. Download the Windows build, or clone and build from source.
3. Launch the app. It detects CUDA or Vulkan and falls back to CPU.
4. Open image generation, pick a model that fits your VRAM, and download it.
5. Type a prompt, choose a style preset, and generate. Images stay on your PC.

## What's Coming

- More image models as open weights ship.
- Cross-device sync, so your gallery follows you between machines, still private.
- Tighter ties between image generation and the rest of the local studio.

Grounded roadmap. The local spine comes first.

## FAQ

### Q: Is it really free?
Yes. The app is free and open source under AGPL-3.0. No subscription, no account, no per-image charge.

### Q: Does it work offline?
Yes. Once a model is downloaded, you can disconnect entirely. Generation runs locally.

### Q: Do I need an NVIDIA GPU?
No. NVIDIA uses CUDA and is fastest. AMD and Intel GPUs use Vulkan. A modern CPU can run smaller models without any GPU.

### Q: Which image models can I run?
SDXL, SDXL-Lightning, SD 1.5, SD 2.1, and Z-Image-Turbo. Pick and download them from inside the app.

### Q: How much VRAM do I need?
8GB runs SDXL-Lightning and Z-Image-Turbo smoothly. 12GB or more makes full SDXL and larger sizes comfortable. 4-6GB handles SD 1.5 and low-step output.

### Q: Is my data private?
Yes. Prompts and images never leave your PC. No telemetry, no account, and the source is open to inspect.
