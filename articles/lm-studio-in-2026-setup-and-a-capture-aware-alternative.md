A consumer GPU with 12GB of VRAM can run a quantized 13B language model entirely on your own machine. That card sits mostly idle while you pay a monthly fee to run the same kind of model on someone else's hardware. Off Grid AI Desktop is a free, open-source app that runs local models directly on your Mac or PC, with the same download-and-chat feel as LM Studio plus a lot more.

Free, open source, runs offline.

## What LM Studio Is

LM Studio is a desktop app for running open-weight language models locally. It gives you a graphical model browser tied to Hugging Face, a one-click download manager, and a chat window. You pick a GGUF file, it loads, and you talk to it. It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux, with GPU acceleration where available.

It also runs a local server that other tools can call. That makes it a popular front-end for people who want local chat without touching a terminal.

## How to Set Up LM Studio

The flow is straightforward.

1. Download and install LM Studio for your OS.
2. Open the model search and find a model that fits your memory.
3. Download the GGUF file.
4. Load the model and start chatting.

You can tune sampling settings and the context window per model. The server tab exposes an endpoint on `localhost` for scripts and plugins. For local text chat with a clean GUI, it does the job well.

The boundary is scope. LM Studio is a chat and model-serving tool. It does not generate images, transcribe your voice, read documents back to you, or chat with your own files. If you want one app that does all of that on-device, you need something wider.

## A Capture-Aware Alternative: Off Grid AI Desktop

Off Grid AI Desktop keeps the part you like about LM Studio. You browse Hugging Face inside the app, download a GGUF, and chat with temperature and context controls, all backed by a bundled `llama.cpp` server. Then it adds the rest of a local AI studio, and it is open source so you can read every line.

Here is what you get on top of local chat.

- **On-device image generation.** SDXL, SDXL-Lightning for fast few-step results, SD 1.5/2.1, and the 2026 Z-Image-Turbo model. Text-to-image and image-to-image, with a live per-step preview, ETA, cancel, a lightbox, an artifacts gallery, and style presets.
- **Voice both ways.** Whisper.cpp turns your mic into composer text. Kokoro-82M reads messages back, with an auto-speak mode.
- **Chat with your documents (RAG).** Upload PDFs, Word docs, text, images, or audio. The app builds on-device embeddings and a local vector store, then answers with cited sources.
- **Live canvas.** When the model writes HTML, SVG, Mermaid, or React, it renders in a sandboxed iframe with no network or file access. Toggle code and preview, then download.

The "capture-aware" part is the difference LM Studio cannot match. With explicit opt-in and a visible recording indicator, the app can watch a screen frame, run OCR, and have the local model distill what you were working on into observations and entities. That builds a private memory of your work that your chat can draw on. You stay in control: it is per-device, opt-in, and shows you when it is on.

## What You Need

The app runs on Apple Silicon Macs and Windows PCs.

| Tier | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum | M1, 8GB unified memory, macOS 13, 15GB free | 16GB RAM, GTX 1660 or newer, Windows 10, 15GB free |
| Recommended | M2/M3/M4, 16GB+ unified memory, macOS 14+, 30GB free | 32GB RAM, RTX 3060 12GB or better, Windows 11, 30GB free |

Image generation likes more VRAM than text chat. The recommended tier handles SDXL without much waiting.

## Which Models to Use

Match the model to your memory, same as you would in LM Studio.

| Your device | Model to try | What to expect |
|---|---|---|
| 8GB Mac / 16GB PC | Gemma 3 4B (Q4_K) | Quick everyday chat and drafting |
| 16GB Mac / 32GB PC | Qwen 2.5 7B (q8_0) | Better reasoning and code |
| 32GB+ | A 12B-14B class model | Top quality, slower first token |

## How Hardware Acceleration Works

On a Mac, models run on the GPU through Metal, and Apple Silicon shares one memory pool between CPU and GPU. That unified memory is why a laptop holds a 7B model and stays responsive.

On Windows, acceleration uses CUDA on NVIDIA cards or Vulkan elsewhere, with a CPU fallback that works but runs slower.

Quantization makes it fit. A q8_0 or Q4_K model uses a fraction of the memory of full precision, with little quality loss for chat. That is how chat, images, and RAG all fit on a normal machine.

## Picking the Right Quantization

If a model loads slowly or responses lag, drop to a smaller quantization. Q4_K is a good default for chat on tight memory. Move to q8_0 when you have room and want sharper answers.

For image generation, reserve VRAM by closing other GPU apps first. SDXL-Lightning gives you results in a handful of steps when you want speed over maximum detail.

Trim the context window when a chat is short. Long context reserves memory whether you fill it or not.

## Privacy: Stronger Than a Cloud Assistant

A cloud tool sends your prompts, uploads, and voice to a remote server under a policy you cannot audit.

Off Grid AI Desktop sends nothing. No account, no telemetry, no API key. Your chats, images, documents, and any captured memory stay on your disk. The source is open to inspection. Disconnect from the network and it keeps running.

## Getting Started

1. Open the repo at [github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop).
2. Download the build for your OS, or clone and build from source.
3. Launch the app.
4. Open the models browser, pick a model that fits your memory, and download it.
5. Chat, generate an image, drop in a document, or enable capture.

## What's Coming

- Cross-device sync so chats and memory follow you between machines.
- More language and image models as they ship.
- Unified search across chats, documents, and captured work.
- A richer day view built from what the app remembers.

## FAQ

### Q: Is it really free?
Yes. The core app is free and open source. The features here are not behind a paywall.

### Q: Does it work offline?
Yes. Download a model once, then disconnect. Everything runs on-device.

### Q: Can I use the same models as LM Studio?
Yes. Both run open-weight GGUF models. Use the in-app browser to find and download them.

### Q: How much RAM do I need?
8GB on a Mac or 16GB on a PC runs a small model. 16GB or more is better, especially for images.

### Q: Does it run on Windows and Mac?
Yes, both. Macs use Metal, Windows uses CUDA or Vulkan with CPU fallback.

### Q: Is my data private?
Yes. No account, no telemetry, no servers. Your data, including any captured memory, stays on your machine.
