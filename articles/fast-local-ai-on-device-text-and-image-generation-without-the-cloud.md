The slowest part of a cloud AI request is not the model. It is the trip to a data center, the wait in a queue behind other users, and the rate limit that stops you mid-thought. Off Grid AI Desktop deletes all three by running the model on your own machine. It is a free, open-source app for macOS and Windows that generates text and images locally, with no server in the loop.

Free, open-source (AGPL-3.0), runs offline. No account, no telemetry.

## Where cloud time actually goes

People assume local AI must be slower because your laptop is smaller than a data center. The assumption misses where the time goes.

A cloud request leaves your machine, crosses the network, waits in a shared queue, runs, then crosses back. On a busy day the wait dominates. Then the rate limit kicks in and you stop entirely. None of that is compute. It is logistics.

Local AI has none of those steps. The model is already on your disk. There is no network hop, no queue, no other users, no quota. The latency you feel is the model thinking, and nothing else.

## Why the local model is genuinely quick

Speed here comes from four design choices, not from magic.

**Quantized models.** Off Grid runs GGUF models at q8_0 or Q4_K. Quantization shrinks the weights so they fit in consumer RAM and VRAM, which keeps the model close to the compute instead of spilling to slow storage.

**GPU acceleration.** On a Mac, the bundled `llama.cpp` uses Metal and the unified memory pool, so the CPU and GPU share one fast address space with no copying. On Windows, it uses CUDA on NVIDIA cards or Vulkan elsewhere, with a CPU fallback that still runs.

**Few-step image models.** Image generation uses `stable-diffusion.cpp` with models built for speed. SDXL-Lightning and SDXL-Turbo produce a usable image in a handful of steps. Z-Image-Turbo, the 2026 model, runs in roughly eight steps. Fewer steps means less work per image.

**No network.** The biggest speedup is the one you do not see. Generation starts the instant you hit enter, because there is nothing to send anywhere.

## You watch it work

Local generation is not a black box with a spinner. For images you get a live per-step preview, a progress bar with an ETA, and a cancel button. If a composition is going wrong by step three, you stop it and reroll instead of waiting for a cloud job to finish and bill you.

For chat, tokens stream as the model produces them, so you start reading the answer before it is done.

## Local vs cloud, step by step

| Step | Cloud AI | Off Grid (local) |
|---|---|---|
| Send request over network | Yes | No |
| Wait in a shared queue | Often | Never |
| Model runs | Remote GPU | Your GPU |
| Rate limit can stop you | Yes | No |
| Return trip over network | Yes | No |
| Works with the network off | No | Yes |

The cloud row has four steps that are pure overhead. The local row deletes them.

## Models load on demand

You are not paying a memory tax for features you are not using. The app loads the model the current task needs and releases it when you move on. Chat does not hold the image model in memory, and image generation does not hold the chat model. That keeps a consumer machine responsive while still giving you the full multimodal stack.

## Tips for keeping it fast

Real, simple guidance.

- **Match the model to your memory.** Pick a quantization that fits your RAM or VRAM with headroom. A model that fits stays fast; one that overflows pages to disk and crawls.
- **Use few-step image models for iteration.** Reach for SDXL-Lightning or Z-Image-Turbo while you explore. Save the heavier multi-step runs for the final piece.
- **Trim the context window.** A shorter context is faster to process. Keep the chat focused instead of dragging a long history through every turn.
- **Cancel early.** Use the per-step preview. If an image is wrong, cancel and reroll rather than waiting it out.

## A local endpoint for your own tools

Off Grid ships an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://127.0.0.1:7878/v1`. Point an editor plugin or a script at it and get the same low-latency, no-queue, no-key behavior from your own code. Because it is `127.0.0.1`, there is no network hop at all.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:7878/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"write a haiku"}]}'
```

## Getting started

1. Open [github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop).
2. Download or clone, then install for macOS or Windows.
3. Launch the app and open the models browser.
4. Download a quantized GGUF model that fits your memory, and chat.
5. Open image generation, pick a few-step model, and watch the per-step preview.

## What is coming

- Cross-device sync over a private mesh.
- Using the local gateway from other paired devices over that mesh.
- More few-step and quantized models as the formats improve.

## FAQ

### Q: Is local really faster than the cloud?
For interaction, often yes. There is no network trip, no queue, and no rate limit. The exact speed depends on your hardware and the model you pick.

### Q: What makes it fast?
Quantized GGUF models, GPU acceleration (Metal on Mac, CUDA or Vulkan on Windows), few-step image models, and no network.

### Q: Do I need a high-end GPU?
No. Smaller quantized models run on modest machines, and there is a CPU fallback. More memory and a stronger GPU let you run larger models faster.

### Q: How fast is image generation?
Few-step models like SDXL-Lightning and Z-Image-Turbo generate in a handful of steps, with a live preview and a cancel button. Speed scales with your GPU.

### Q: Does it work offline?
Yes. Once a model is downloaded, text and image generation run with the network off.

### Q: Is it free?
Yes. Free and open-source under AGPL-3.0. No account, no telemetry, no API keys.

No queue, no rate limit, no round-trip. Just your machine, working. **[Get it on GitHub →](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop)**
