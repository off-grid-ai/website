A modern laptop ships with 16GB or more of unified memory and a GPU that idles at single-digit percent most of the day. That hardware can run a 7B language model right now, no internet needed. Most people still pay a monthly subscription to send every prompt to a server they do not own. Off Grid AI Desktop is a free, open-source app that runs local models directly on your Mac or PC, and it does more than chat.

Free, open source, runs offline.

## What Ollama Is

Ollama is a command-line tool that downloads and runs open-weight language models on your machine. You install it once, then pull a model and talk to it. It handles the model files, the runtime, and an HTTP API on `localhost`. It works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

The appeal is simple. You type one command and you have a local model running. No account, no API key, no token meter ticking in the background.

## How to Use Ollama (No Configuration Required)

Install it, then pull and run a model in two commands.

```bash
# after installing from ollama.com
ollama run gemma3:4b
```

That single command downloads the model on first run, then drops you into a chat prompt in your terminal. Ask a question, get an answer, all on-device.

Want a different model? Swap the name.

```bash
ollama run qwen2.5:7b
```

Ollama also exposes an API on port 11434, so other tools can send it prompts. That is how editor plugins and scripts talk to it. The defaults work out of the box, which is the whole point of the "no configuration" promise.

The limit is the interface. Ollama is a terminal and an API. If you want to see your images, scrub a conversation, talk to a document, or keep a searchable history with a real UI, you bolt on a separate front-end. That is where a desktop app helps.

## A Local-First Alternative: Off Grid AI Desktop

Off Grid AI Desktop runs local models like Ollama does, with a bundled `llama.cpp` server instead of a terminal. You get a window, a model picker, and a chat you can actually read. Then it adds the parts a command line cannot give you.

You get local chat with temperature and context-window controls. You get image generation. You get voice in and voice out. You get a private place to chat with your own documents. All of it stays on your machine.

Here is what it does beyond chat.

- **Image generation on-device.** Run SDXL, SDXL-Lightning, SD 1.5/2.1, or the 2026 Z-Image-Turbo model. You get text-to-image and image-to-image, a live per-step preview, progress and ETA, cancel, a lightbox, and a gallery of what you made.
- **Voice in.** A bundled whisper.cpp turns your mic into text in the composer. Speak instead of type.
- **Voice out.** Kokoro-82M reads any message back to you, with an auto-speak mode for hands-free use.
- **Chat with your documents.** Drop in PDFs, Word files, text, images, or audio. The app builds on-device embeddings and a local vector store, then answers with cited sources.
- **A built-in models browser.** Search Hugging Face, download a GGUF, and run it, without leaving the app or touching a config file.

## What You Need

Off Grid AI Desktop runs on Apple Silicon Macs and on Windows PCs.

| Tier | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum | M1, 8GB unified memory, macOS 13, 15GB free | 16GB RAM, GTX 1660 or newer, Windows 10, 15GB free |
| Recommended | M2/M3/M4, 16GB+ unified memory, macOS 14+, 30GB free | 32GB RAM, RTX 3060 12GB or better, Windows 11, 30GB free |

More memory means bigger models and longer context. The minimum tier runs a 3B to 7B model comfortably.

## Which Models to Use

Pick a model that fits your memory. Quantized GGUF files are small enough for consumer hardware.

| Your device | Model to try | What to expect |
|---|---|---|
| 8GB Mac / 16GB PC | Gemma 3 4B (Q4_K) | Fast replies, good for everyday questions and drafting |
| 16GB Mac / 32GB PC | Qwen 2.5 7B (q8_0) | Stronger reasoning and code, still snappy |
| 32GB+ | A 12B-14B class model | Best quality, slower first token |

These are the same open-weight families Ollama pulls, so nothing here is locked in.

## How Hardware Acceleration Works

On a Mac, the model runs on the GPU through Metal, and Apple Silicon shares one pool of memory between CPU and GPU. That unified memory is why a laptop can hold a 7B model and respond fast.

On Windows, acceleration runs through CUDA on NVIDIA cards or Vulkan on others. No GPU? CPU fallback still works, just slower.

Quantization is the trick that makes this fit. A model stored at q8_0 or Q4_K uses a fraction of the memory of the full-precision version, with little quality loss for chat. That is how the whole studio fits on a normal machine.

## Keeping It Fast

Match the model to your memory. If responses crawl or the app swaps to disk, drop to a smaller quantization or a smaller model.

Trim the context window when you do not need it. A 32K context costs memory whether you use it or not. For short chats, a smaller window frees room for a faster model.

Close other GPU-hungry apps before a long image-generation run. The GPU is shared, and an idle browser tab with video can steal cycles.

## Privacy: Stronger Than a Cloud Chat App

A cloud assistant sends your prompts, your uploads, and your voice to a remote server. You trust a retention policy you cannot inspect.

Off Grid AI Desktop sends nothing. There is no account, no telemetry, and no API key. Your chats, images, and documents live on your disk. The code is open, so you can read exactly what it does. Pull the network cable and it keeps working.

## Getting Started

1. Open the repo at [github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop).
2. Download the build for your OS, or clone and build from source.
3. Launch the app.
4. Open the models browser, pick a model that fits your memory, and download it.
5. Start a chat, generate an image, or drop in a document.

You are running local AI in a few minutes, with a real interface.

## What's Coming

- Cross-device sync so your memory and chats follow you between machines.
- More image and language models as they ship.
- Unified search across chats, documents, and captured work.
- Deeper screen-capture-to-memory so the app remembers what you worked on.

## FAQ

### Q: Is it really free?
Yes. The core app is free and open source. No tier gate on the features in this article.

### Q: Does it work offline?
Yes. After you download a model, you can disconnect entirely. Everything runs on-device.

### Q: Can I use the same models as Ollama?
Yes. Both run open-weight GGUF models from families like Gemma and Qwen. Use the built-in browser to download them.

### Q: How much RAM do I need?
8GB on a Mac or 16GB on a PC runs a small model. 16GB or more lets you run 7B and larger.

### Q: Does it run on Windows and Mac?
Yes, both. Macs use Metal, Windows uses CUDA or Vulkan with CPU fallback.

### Q: Is my data private?
Yes. No account, no telemetry, no servers. Your data stays on your machine.
