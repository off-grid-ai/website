The M3 Max in your laptop ships with up to 40 GPU cores and shares memory with the CPU, so a 6 GB image model loads without copying anything across a bus. That hardware sits idle while you pay a monthly subscription to generate photos on someone else's server, where every prompt is logged. Off Grid AI Desktop is a free, open-source app that runs Juggernaut XL v9 directly on your Mac or PC.

Free, open-source, runs fully offline.

## Why Juggernaut XL

Juggernaut XL v9 is a photorealistic SDXL checkpoint from RunDiffusion. It is tuned for realism: skin texture, natural lighting, depth of field, and the kind of grain you get from a real lens. If you want portraits, product shots, or photographs that read as photographs rather than illustrations, this is the checkpoint to reach for.

We publish it quantized to GGUF so it runs on `stable-diffusion.cpp`. The model page is here:

A GGUF build means the weights are packed down to fit consumer RAM and VRAM. You download one file, point the app at it, and generate. No Python environment, no CUDA toolkit install, no diffusers dependency hell.

## What You Need

Hardware in two tiers. Pick the row that matches your machine.

| Tier | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum | M1, 16 GB unified memory, macOS 13+, 12 GB free disk | NVIDIA GPU with 8 GB VRAM (or Vulkan-capable), 16 GB RAM, 12 GB free disk |
| Recommended | M3 / M4 Pro or Max, 24 GB+ unified memory | RTX 3060 12 GB or better, 32 GB RAM |

SDXL checkpoints are larger than SD 1.5. The GGUF build keeps the download in single-digit gigabytes, but you want headroom in memory so the OS does not start swapping mid-render.

## What Off Grid AI Desktop Can Do

The image studio is one tab in a full local AI app. Here is what you get for this workflow.

- Generate photorealistic images from a text prompt, fully on-device.
- Watch each diffusion step render live, so you can cancel a bad seed early instead of waiting for the full run.
- Feed an existing photo back in with img2img to restyle or refine it.
- Apply style presets (Cinematic, Sketch, Anime, and more) without rewriting your prompt.
- Keep every output in an artifacts gallery with a lightbox for side-by-side comparison.

You also get local LLM chat, voice in and out, and a Hugging Face model browser in the same app, so you can write a prompt with a local model and generate from it without leaving the window.

## How Hardware Acceleration Works

On a Mac, Off Grid AI Desktop uses Metal. Apple Silicon shares one pool of memory between CPU and GPU, so the model weights do not get copied back and forth the way they do on a discrete-GPU PC. That unified memory is why a 16 GB MacBook can run a checkpoint that would need a dedicated 8 GB card on a desktop.

On Windows, the same `stable-diffusion.cpp` engine runs on CUDA for NVIDIA cards or Vulkan for broader GPU support, and falls back to CPU if you have no usable GPU. CPU generation is slower but it works.

Quantization is what makes any of this fit. The original Juggernaut weights are large. The GGUF build trades a small amount of precision for a much smaller file, and at SDXL resolutions the visual difference is hard to spot.

## Keeping It Fast

A few practical levers, no invented numbers.

- Start at 768x768 or the native SDXL 1024x1024, then upscale a keeper rather than running everything at high resolution.
- Use the live preview to kill bad seeds at step 5 or 6 instead of waiting for step 30.
- Close other GPU-heavy apps. On a Mac, leave a few gigabytes of unified memory free so macOS does not compress memory under pressure.
- Lower the step count when you are exploring prompts, then raise it for the final render.

## Privacy: Stronger Than Midjourney

Midjourney runs on Discord. Your prompts and your images live on their servers, and the default gallery is public. Off Grid AI Desktop is the opposite arrangement.

Your prompt never leaves your machine. The image is computed locally and saved to your disk. There is no account, no telemetry, no API key. The app is open source, so you can read the source and confirm that for yourself. Pull the network cable and it still generates.

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone Off Grid AI Desktop from [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop).
2. Install and launch it (macOS and Windows builds available).
3. Open the model browser and download the Juggernaut XL v9 GGUF, or grab it from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/offgrid-ai/juggernaut-xl-v9-GGUF) directly.
4. Open the image tab, select Juggernaut XL as your model, and type a prompt.
5. Generate. Watch the live preview, save the keepers from the gallery.

```text
# Example prompt to start with
portrait of a woman, soft window light, 85mm lens,
shallow depth of field, natural skin texture, film grain
```

## What's Coming

- More curated SDXL checkpoints in the model browser.
- Cross-device sync so a render started on your desktop shows up on your other machine.
- Unified search across your generated artifacts.

## FAQ

### Q: Is it really free?

Yes. The app is free and open-source. The model is a free download. There is no paid tier gating image generation.

### Q: Does it work offline?

Yes. Once the app and the model are downloaded, you can disconnect from the internet. Generation happens entirely on your device.

### Q: How much RAM do I need?

16 GB is the floor for SDXL-class models. 24 GB or more gives you room to run other apps at the same time.

### Q: Does it run on Windows?

Yes. The same engine runs on CUDA, Vulkan, or CPU on Windows. A 12 GB NVIDIA card is the comfortable target.

### Q: Is my data private?

Your prompts and images stay on your disk. No account, no telemetry, no server we own ever sees them.

### Q: What is Juggernaut XL good at?

Photorealism. Portraits, product photography, and natural scenes where you want output that looks shot, not drawn.

Run photorealistic image generation on your own hardware, for free.
