The GPU in a modern laptop can run a full SDXL anime model without ever touching the internet. That hardware sits idle most of the day while you pay a monthly subscription to generate images on someone else's server. Off Grid AI Desktop is a free, open-source app that runs Animagine XL 4.0 directly on your Mac or PC.

**[GitHub →](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop)** Free, open-source, runs offline.

Animagine XL 4.0 is an anime-focused SDXL checkpoint. It uses tag-based prompting, the booru-style keyword approach anime models are trained on. You type tags, not paragraphs. The model knows the vocabulary. This guide shows you how to run it locally with no token meter and no upload of your prompts to anyone.

## What You Need

The model is a quantized GGUF build, so it fits in consumer memory. Pick your tier.

| Tier | Hardware | RAM / VRAM | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum | Apple Silicon M1, or a GPU with 6 GB VRAM | 16 GB | 8 GB free |
| Recommended | M2/M3/M4, or NVIDIA RTX with 8 GB+ VRAM | 32 GB | 12 GB free |

On macOS you want a recent version with Metal support. On Windows you want current NVIDIA or AMD drivers. CPU-only generation works but it is slow, so treat a GPU as the real baseline.

## What Off Grid AI Desktop Can Do

The image studio runs on `stable-diffusion.cpp`. You get a real workflow, not a single text box.

- Type a prompt and watch the image build. A live per-step preview shows the picture forming as the model denoises.
- See progress and an ETA while it runs. Cancel any generation you do not like without waiting for it to finish.
- Open results in a lightbox and keep them in an artifacts gallery so you can compare runs side by side.
- Start from text (txt2img) or feed in a reference image (img2img) when you want to keep a pose or composition.
- Use style presets like Anime, Cinematic, and Sketch as a starting point, then refine with tags.

Every one of those results stays on your disk. Nothing uploads. You can pull the wifi and keep working.

## Tag-Based Prompting, Briefly

Animagine XL 4.0 responds to booru tags, not prose. A prompt reads more like a list than a sentence.

```plaintext
1girl, silver hair, red eyes, school uniform, cherry blossoms,
looking at viewer, masterpiece, best quality
```

Order matters less than presence. Lead with the subject, add appearance tags, then quality tags. Add a negative prompt for what you want to keep out (`lowres, bad anatomy, extra fingers`). If a character looks off, change a tag, not the whole sentence. This is the fast way to iterate, and it costs you nothing to try a hundred variations.

## How Hardware Acceleration Works

On a Mac, the model runs on Metal and uses unified memory, so the GPU reads the same memory pool as the CPU with no copy step. On Windows, it runs on CUDA for NVIDIA cards or Vulkan as a broader fallback, with CPU as the last resort.

The quantization is what makes this practical. A full-precision SDXL checkpoint is large. The GGUF build is quantized down so the weights fit in the memory a normal machine has. You trade a small amount of fidelity for the ability to run the whole thing on your own GPU. For anime art, where the style is clean and stylized to begin with, that trade is easy to accept.

## Keeping It Fast

A few habits make local generation feel quick.

- Generate at the resolution SDXL was trained for (around 1024 px on the long edge), then upscale later if you need more. Pushing far past that slows every step and can distort anatomy.
- Keep your step count reasonable. More steps is not always better, and each step costs time.
- Close other heavy apps. Image models want the memory, and a browser with forty tabs is competing for it.
- Reuse a seed when you have a result you almost like. Lock the seed, change one tag, and you keep the composition while you tune.

## Privacy: Stronger Than a Cloud Image Service

A hosted anime generator sees every prompt you type and every image you make. It keeps logs. It often trains on what you submit. You agree to terms you did not read.

Off Grid AI Desktop runs the model on your machine. There is no account and no telemetry. Your prompts and images never leave the device. The app is open source, so you can read exactly what it does. The difference is not a setting you toggle. It is the architecture.

## Getting Started

1. Go to the repo and download or clone Off Grid AI Desktop: https://github.com/off-grid-ai/desktop
2. Install and launch it on your Mac or PC.
3. Open the Models browser and find the Animagine XL 4.0 GGUF build: https://huggingface.co/offgrid-ai/animagine-xl-4.0-GGUF
4. Download it with the built-in download manager and select it as your image model.
5. Open the image studio, type a tag prompt, and generate.

## What's Coming

- More curated GGUF image checkpoints in the Models browser.
- Cross-device sync so your gallery follows you between machines.
- Continued tuning of the live preview and generation controls.

## FAQ

### Q: Is it really free?

Yes. The app is free and open-source. The model is a free download from Hugging Face. No subscription, no credits.

### Q: Does it work fully offline?

Yes. After you download the app and the model once, generation runs with no network. You can disconnect entirely.

### Q: Which model should I use for anime?

Animagine XL 4.0 is built for it. It expects booru tags and produces clean anime art. Use the GGUF build linked above so it fits in normal memory.

### Q: How much RAM do I need?

16 GB is the floor on Apple Silicon. 32 GB is more comfortable, especially if you keep other apps open while generating.

### Q: Does it run on Windows or only Mac?

Both. Macs use Metal. Windows uses CUDA or Vulkan, with a CPU fallback.

### Q: Is my data private?

Yes. Nothing leaves your machine. No account, no telemetry, no prompt logging on a server.

Run Animagine XL 4.0 on your own hardware, offline, today.
